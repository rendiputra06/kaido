- [x] Prerequisite validation for courses
- [x] Quota availability checks

### ✅ Data Integrity
- [x] Atomic transactions for quota reduction
- [x] Database constraints to prevent invalid data
- [x] Foreign key constraints for referential integrity
- [x] Rollback mechanism for failed transactions

## API Security

### ✅ Rate Limiting
- [x] API rate limiting to prevent abuse
- [x] Throttling for login attempts
- [x] Request size limits

### ✅ Data Exposure
- [x] Sensitive data filtering in API responses
- [x] No exposure of internal system details
- [x] Proper error handling without information leakage
- [x] Pagination for large datasets

## Database Security

### ✅ SQL Injection Prevention
- [x] Use of Eloquent ORM with parameter binding
- [x] No raw SQL queries with user input
- [x] Prepared statements for all database operations

### ✅ Data Encryption
- [x] Sensitive data encryption at rest (if applicable)
- [x] HTTPS enforcement for data in transit
- [x] Password hashing using bcrypt

## File Upload Security

### ✅ File Validation
- [x] File type validation (if document uploads are implemented)
- [x] File size limits
- [x] Virus scanning for uploaded files
- [x] Secure file storage location

## Audit & Logging

### ✅ Activity Logging
- [x] Log all KRS submissions and approvals
- [x] Track quota changes with timestamps
- [x] Monitor failed login attempts
- [x] Audit trail for grade changes

### ✅ Error Monitoring
- [x] Centralized error logging
- [x] Real-time alerts for security incidents
- [x] Performance monitoring

## Access Control Implementation

### ✅ Route Protection
```php
// Example route protection
Route::middleware(['auth', 'role:mahasiswa'])->group(function () {
    Route::get('/krs', [KrsController::class, 'index']);
    Route::post('/krs', [KrsController::class, 'store']);
});

Route::middleware(['auth', 'role:dosen'])->group(function () {
    Route::get('/krs/pending', [KrsController::class, 'pending']);
    Route::put('/krs/{id}/approve', [KrsController::class, 'approve']);
});
```

### ✅ Policy Implementation
```php
// Example policy for KRS authorization
class KrsPolicy
{
    public function view(User $user, KrsMahasiswa $krs): bool
    {
        return $user->id === $krs->mahasiswa->user_id ||
               $user->id === $krs->mahasiswa->dosenPa->user_id ||
               $user->hasRole('admin');
    }
    
    public function approve(User $user, KrsMahasiswa $krs): bool
    {
        return $user->id === $krs->mahasiswa->dosenPa->user_id;
    }
}
```

## Security Headers

### ✅ Security Headers Implementation
- [x] X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- [x] X-Frame-Options: DENY
- [x] X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
- [x] Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
- [x] Content-Security-Policy (CSP)

## Testing Security

### ✅ Security Testing
- [x] Penetration testing scenarios
- [x] SQL injection test cases
- [x] XSS vulnerability testing
- [x] CSRF attack prevention testing
- [x] Authentication bypass testing

### ✅ Automated Security Tests
```php
// Example security test
public function test_cannot_access_other_student_krs()
{
    $otherStudent = Mahasiswa::factory()->create();
    $krs = KrsMahasiswa::factory()->create([
        'mahasiswa_id' => $otherStudent->id
    ]);
    
    $response = $this->actingAs($this->mahasiswaUser)
        ->getJson("/api/krs/{$krs->id}");
        
    $response->assertStatus(403);
}
```
